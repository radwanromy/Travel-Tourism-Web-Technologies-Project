 Introduction
</summary>
 Modern life has become hectic, surrounded by so many 
responsibilities. Fulfilling those responsibilities life becomes 
monotonous. To restore energy and get sometime out of this 
gloomy, busy life people want to get lost in the serenity of 
mother-nature. Hence, they like to travel. But when it comes to 
travelling, there comes so many things to be considered –
which place to go, is it safe, how much time will it take to go, 
what are the available transport systems, are there any hotels 
to stay, how much do they cost, which are the tourist spots, etc. 
People want to go for travelling to be relieved from stress, but 
they become more stressed when planning for a tour. So, the 
main objective of our system is to give all the necessary 
information about the places and make necessary 
arrangements such as, transportations, hotel booking, rent-vehicles facilities to go around the places. Our goal is to ensure that 
the user doesn’t have to go through any hassle and enjoy their 
trip fully.

Background Study
</summary>

This is a system to ease the planning of 
tour for a user. If a user is not already a member he needs to 
sign up, otherwise he signs in with his email and password. The 
system checks user’s email and password. If the email and 
password is correct then the user goes to the homepage of the 
system, otherwise the system prompt an error message saying, 
“Incorrect Password!” If a user forgets his password, he can
recover his password by clicking on “Forgot Password” section. 
An email with password recovery is sent to user’s email address 
by the system in order to retrieve the password. In the 
homepage, a user can search for a place by division or by 
popularity or by name. System provides the details of the place 
that user searched, with descriptions, photos and reviews by 
other users who already visited it. A user can mark the place as 
interested by tapping a star sign by the place name. This will 
help the user to get notified with new reviews or photos about 
the place. If a user want make a booking for a place of his 
choice, he can tap on the booking option and a new page for 
booking will pop up. In the booking page, a user can choose the 
time when he wants to visit the place, how many days will he 
stay there etc. A user needs to select a transport system which 
can a bus or a train or a private car or by air. Then he needs to 
select his preferable options to book a hotel either only rooms 
or rooms and foods. After fulfilling all the details a receipt 
showing costs will pop up. User can make the payment by 
online banking.
